Your brother Samuel, the poetic writer, always drinking...forget him.


Introduction_Demon

My name is Charles Dexter. I have been summoned by a greater power to place you in cosmic purgatory. To escape, you must pay me with the memories of those you love. Provide me their belongings to purge their memories from existence.

You have fulfilled all of your payments to me. I hereby release you from cosmic purgatory...for now. We shall meet again, Jonathan...David...Jones.
